        <p style="font-size: 1.5rem;">
        FindMyLost is the first Digital Lost Property tool for Business and Consumer, the only platform that allows you to get your lost item back wherever you are, at any time.

        FindMyLost is focused on businesses and provides, among others, transport companies, municipalities, airports, airlines, hotels, car sharing, shopping malls, amusement parks, universities, and museums, with the possibility to implement their private digital Lost Properties database benefiting from the value-added Customer Care services offered by FindMyLost, which acts as an aggregator.

        The platform also includes a consumer concept where, through the community, the finder can get in direct contact with the rightful owner, return the item and potentially receive a reward.
